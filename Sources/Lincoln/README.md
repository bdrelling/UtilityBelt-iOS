# Lincoln

Lincoln is a logging abstraction framework written in Swift.

While this framework is written and maintained in such a way that might allow for support in other systems, it is primarily intended for use within the `SpotHero` iOS ecosystem. This library is not intended to replace `print`, `NSLog`, `os_log`, or [SwiftLogger](https://github.com/apple/swift-log), but to provide an abstraction around logging in general that we can use across our products.

The code in Lincoln is in _no way_ novel. As such, we recommend _not_ using this library as a dependency within your own products. Instead, feel free to use it as a reference when building your own abstraction layer.

No matter how you use it or if you just find some block of code that is flat-out wrong, always feel free to get in contact with us by submitting an issue within this repository.
